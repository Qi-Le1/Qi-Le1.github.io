I'm a third year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ali Anwar](https://chalianwar.github.io/) and Prof. [Jie Ding](https://jding.org/).

My research interest includes efficient machine learning and distributed machine learning. You can find my CV here: [Qi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
